# KAIZAR Decision Systems

KAIZAR builds high-end AI decision engines: systems that combine forecasting, optimisation,
simulation and strategic modelling into a single adaptive loop. These architectures are designed
for organisations that need to perform under uncertainty and make decisions that truly matter.

This repository contains conceptual documentation, design principles and reference diagrams 
illustrating the foundations of KAIZAR’s decision systems. It does not contain production code: 
all operational models and engines are proprietary and developed specifically for client use cases.

## Architecture Philosophy

- **Prediction → Optimisation → Simulation → Decision**
- A closed feedback loop that continually retrains and improves.
- Modular components that integrate forecasting models, constraint solvers,
  reinforcement mechanisms and scenario simulation.
- Designed for environments where uncertainty is not a problem to avoid,
  but a dimension to exploit.

## Contents

- Conceptual diagrams  
- Architectural notes  
- System flow principles  
- Research ideas and modelling strategies  

KAIZAR was founded by **Tobias Beers**, AI decision engineer with a background in cognitive 
neuroscience, bioinformatics and computational modelling.
